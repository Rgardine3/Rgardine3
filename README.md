# Title of Dataset:Roads and water availability influence the occurrence of koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) in secondary habitat: a multiscale approach
---

# Brief summary of dataset contents, contextualized in experimental procedures and results.

959 sites surveyed with detection dogs to determine the occurrence of koalas through the presence of scats. 
Using GLMMs, we accounted for environmental and anthropogenic variables that may influence koala occurrence, 
meanwhile focusing on the use of secondary eucalyptus forests at multiple spatial scales (250m, 500m, 1500m radii). 

## Description of the Data and file structure

Raw data of occurrence and variables used in GLMMs including proportion of forest area, non-remnant, distance to road and water.
All data was extracted from spatial layers in ArcGIS 10. (see manuscript for which layers and what source) 


Describe relationship between data files, missing data codes, other abbreviations used. Be as descriptive as possible.
